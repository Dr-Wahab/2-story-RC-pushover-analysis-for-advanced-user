Here is a complete pushover analysis and results for a 2-storey RCC frame using OpenSeesPy.
I built the full workflow end-to-end: model definition → gravity load → nonlinear static pushover → capacity curve → drift/hinge interpretation.

Key deliverables included:

Base shear–roof displacement (capacity curve)

Interstorey drift profile to flag critical storey demand

Plastic hinge / yielding sequence (where the nonlinearity concentrates)

Clear plots + a short interpretation summary for performance benchmarking
